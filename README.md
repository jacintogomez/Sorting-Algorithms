# Sorting-Algorithms

This program allows the user to enter an array of integers and watch the step by step process of how a sorting algorithm will work on their array. 
The user can choose one of 7 common sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quicksort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Radix Sort and Heap Sort.

I made this program for the students I TA for, to help them visualize how these sorting algorithms work, as it is something I wish I had when 
learning these concepts.
