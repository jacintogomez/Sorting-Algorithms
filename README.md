# Sorting-Algorithms

This is a program I designed for the students I TA for, to help them visualize how fundamental sorting algorithms work; it is something I wish I had when learning these concepts myself.

This program allows the user to enter an array of integers and watch the step by step process of how a sorting algorithm will work on their array. 
The user can choose one of 9 common sorting algorithms: Mergesort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quicksort, Heapsort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort and Bucket Sort. There is also an option to display information about what the algorithm does, as well as information on best, average and worst case time & space complexity.
